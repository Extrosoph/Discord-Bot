# Discord-Bot
This is a discord bot for my channel which has a few features:
1. Weather Forecast at 7:30, 12:30 and 18:30 am Perth time to tell the weather and the status
2. Annouces new ongoing episode that is just released based on a website using a logger file
3. Gives roles based on a reaction on a message

TODO:
1. Fix the role removal function as it doesn`t remove the role if the reaction is removed
2. Add a feature to add anime to the log file from discord messages
3. Add sunset and sunrise time
4. Fix weather forecast timing

Git updates:

1. heroku login
2. git add .
3. git commit -am "need to add a message"
4. git push heroku master
5. heroku ps:scale worker=1

Check logs:

heroku logs -a sopher-bot
