# Discord-Bot
This is a discord bot for my channel which has a few features:
1. Weather Forecast at 7:30, 12:30 and 18:30 am perth time to tell the weather and the status
2. Annouces new ongoing episode that is just released based on a website using a logger file
3. Gives roles based on a reaction on a message

TODO:
1. Fix the role removal function as it doesn`t remove the role if the reaction is removed

Git updates:
heroku login
git add .
git commit -am "cool"
git push heroku master
heroku ps:scale worker=1
heroku logs -a sopher-bot
